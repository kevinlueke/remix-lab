        Why CPOSC?
      </h2>
      <p class="why-cposc-p">Technology is evolving with unprecendented speed, which means it's more 
      important than ever for those on the front lines of tech to gather, converse and 
      share their experiences. CPOSC offers technologists passionate about open source 
      technologies that very opportunity through presentations, panel discussions, lightning talks, 
      informal designated conversation topic areas, and more.</p>

        Why Downtown Lancaster?
      </h2>
      <p class="why-dl-p">
        As Downtown Lancaster's arts, music, and dining scenes have garnered national recognition
        over the past decade, we firmly believe that the Lancaster tech scene is in the midst of its own
        big boom. By moving downtown beginning in 2016, we wanted CPOSC to be at the center of this tech explosion.
        As a bonus, it's an easy walk from the Ware Center to the CPOSC After Party at

      <h2 class="what">
        What to expect:
      </h2>
      <p class="what-p">Since its start, CPOSC has featured experienced technologists speaking on a variety of 
      open source topics, from introduction level to deep dives and from emerging technologies to those tried-and-tested. 
      You can also find these stories of lessons learned with OSS, as well as niche industries like open source hardware.
      There is something for everyone at CPOSC.</p>
